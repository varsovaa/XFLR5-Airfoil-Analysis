# XFLR5 Airfoil Analysis – Week 1
This repository contains the aerodynamic analysis of the NACA 2412 airfoil using XFLR5.  
The study investigates the lift characteristics under multiple Reynolds numbers using batch analysis, and summarizes linear behavior, lift curve slope, and stall performance.
## Objectives
Analyze NACA 2412 across Reynolds numbers Re = 200,000 → 500,000
Generate CL–α curves using batch analysis
Identify the linear lift region
Calculate the lift curve slope (CLα)
Observe how stall angle changes with Re
Establish the foundation for a long-term aerodynamic design project
