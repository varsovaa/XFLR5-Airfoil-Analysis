Week 1 Airfoil Analysis
Airfoil: NACA 2412
RE: 200000-500000
AoA Sweep: -10° to +20°

Results:
Lineer region between 2,44°-7,4°; lift curve is largely Reynolds-independent in this region.

for Re:200000; clα:0,09454

These values give us an approximate value of 0.095 for the clα value.

And if we look at the stall degrees
